This module allows to define two types of analytic account for each contact.

* The Coopérant - Compte analytique des revenus: The default analytic account used in Invoices / Credit Notes, when the product does not have a value. The value on the partner will act as a fallback for those lines having no value yet assigned.

* The Coopérant - Compte analytique des dépenses: Same as the Coopérant - Compte analytique des revenus, but it applies for Vendor Bills / Vendor Refunds.
